# Project_LABI

### About the project
A python [TCP client](codigo/client.py) that establishes a connection with a Speedtest Server, chosen randomly or by the user, and calculates and presents comprehensive details about the internet connection on the console for each test, while simultaneously saving this information in a CSV file <br>
Using RSA cryptosystem, an accompanying signature file, containing the hash (SHA3-512) of the previously obtained CSV file, is generated <br>
The client's constituent functions have been verified through unit testing. These tests can be observed by executing the corresponding  [test file](codigo/test_unitario_funcoes.py)
