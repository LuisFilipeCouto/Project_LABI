# AP2_LABI

### About the project
A python [TCP client](codigo/client.py) that connects to one of the [Speedtest Servers](codigo/servers.json), random or chosen by the user, and prints detailed information about the internet connection on the console on each test it performs, while also saving it on a CSV file.<br>
Using Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem, it outputs a .sig file which contains the hash (SHA3-512) of the CSV file obtained earlier. <br>
The functions that compose the client code were validated using unit testing, as the user can observe by running the [test file](codigo/test_unitario_funcoes.py).

Git was used to manage the project.
