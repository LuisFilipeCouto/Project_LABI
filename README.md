# Project_LABI

### About the project
A python [TCP client](codigo/client.py) that connects to one of the [Speedtest Servers](codigo/servers.json), random or chosen by the user, and prints detailed information about the internet connection on the console, for each each test it performs, while also saving it on a CSV file <br>
Using RSA cryptosystem, it outputs a sig file which contains the hash (SHA3-512) of the CSV file obtained earlier <br>
The functions that compose the client code were validated using unit testing, which can be observed by running the [test file](codigo/test_unitario_funcoes.py)
